== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need an account on Google? =
You only need an Google+ account.

= How do I change default style to my preferences? =
Use google-hangout-events.css in yakadanda-google-hangout-events/css/google-hangout-events.css as reference. Copy that file to your active-theme/css/ as google-hangout-events.css

= How to find event identifier to create a single event shortcode? =
Single Event Example: https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/csnlc77gi4v519jom5gb28217so
The letters after `***.com/u/0/events/c` is an event id, so the event identifier will be `snlc77gi4v519jom5gb28217so` without first letter 'c'.
To create a single event you would place in shortcode `[google+events id="snlc77gi4v519jom5gb28217so"]`
